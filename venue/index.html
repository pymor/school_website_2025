    <h2>Address</h2>
<p>Seminarraumzentrum University of Münster<br>
Orléans-Ring 12<br>
48149 Münster<br>
Germany</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<h4>By plane</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dus.com/en">Airport Düsseldorf</a> is the nearest airport equipped with an international transport network. You can reach Münster from airport by train in about 90 minutes. For more details see the Travel Service of "<a href="https://int.bahn.de/en">Deutsche Bahn</a>". Alternatively, the <a href="https://www.fmo.de/en/">Airport Münster-Osnabrück</a>, which has a significantly smaller transport system, is located about 30 km in the north of Münster.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Airport Münster-Osnabrück --&gt; Münster (Westf.) Central Station</strong><br>
    The Airport Münster-Osnabrück is located about 30 km north of Münster and offers daily scheduled flights to various destinations within Germany and Europe. The airport offers a shuttle service to Münster's main railway station which runs approximately every 30 minutes. You can buy a ticket on the bus for about 5 Euro. The journey takes about 35 minutes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dortmund Airport --&gt; Münster (Westf.) Central Station</strong><br>
    There is a regional train that runs from Dortmund airport (Holzwickede station) to Münster main station. The station in Dortmund-Holzwickede can be reached by a shuttle bus from the airport within 5 minutes. The complete journey takes between 1 - 1.5 hours.</li>
<li>
<strong>Düsseldorf Airport --&gt; Münster (Westf.) Central Station</strong><br>
    The nearest airport with a good international route network is Düsseldorf Airport.
    There is a direct train from Düsseldorf to Münster on platform 5. This takes just under 1.5 hours.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cologne/Bonn Airport --&gt; Münster (West) Central Station</strong><br>
    When you arrive at Cologne/Bonn Airport, you have to change trains once. Either at Cologne Central Station, Cologne Deutz Station or Essen Central Station. The whole journey takes about 2.5 hours.</li>
<li>
<strong>Frankfurt Airport --&gt; Münster (West) Central Station</strong><br>
    To get from Frankfurt Airport to Münster, you can take a direct train from platform FERN 7. The journey takes about 3.5 hours.
    Alternatively, you can also travel via Dortmund and change trains there. In this case you leave from platform FERN 6 and need about 2.5 hours for the whole journey.</li>
</ul>
<h4>By public transport</h4>
<p>Münster is well connected by train and bus. See the website of "Deutsche Bahn" for more travel details.</p>
<p>Several bus lines lead from Münster railway station to the department building. It is best to take the bus lines 5, 11, 12, 22 in the direction of Gievenbeck or Nienberge. Get off at bus stop "<strong>Coesfelder Kreuz</strong>" after about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>To get to the Seminarraumzentrum, cross the street with traffic lights. Make a left right after the crossing, walk straight till you turn right onto a parking lot. The entrace is on the far side of the building.</p>
<p>As an alternative, take a taxi from the main station to the Seminarraumzentrum at "Orléans-Ring 12".</p>
<h4>By car</h4>
<p><strong>Coming from the south</strong>, take the motorway A1 or A43 north. If on A1, change to A43 at the motorway interchange Münster South, direction Münster. When the motorway ends by the traffic lights go ahead for another 500 meters, then turn left following the signs to "Universitätsklinik" (university hospital). Follow this road over a bridge and several traffic lights. At the crossing where the road signs leading to the hospital point left, go straight ahead (there should be a big concrete car park to your left) - the Seminarraumzentrum is now already on your right side, take the entrance to the Seminarraumzentrum's parking after about 20 meters. Attention - this can be easily overlooked! If so just U-turn twice.</p>
<p><strong>From North:</strong> Take A1 direction South. At exit Münster North, leave A1, direction Münster. You are now on B54 heading Münster, follow instructions from West below.</p>
<p><strong>From West (Netherlands):</strong> If you want to avoid taking the northern motorways, take the B54 into Münster (from Enschede). Pass the motorway entrance and drive right into town. At the first major crossing with traffic lights in Münster there is a sign to "Coesfeld", pointing right. Follow it. At the second traffic light, there is a parking block on your right. Take an U-Turn and go right after 20 meters into the entrance of the Seminarraumzentrum.</p>
<p>The <strong>parking space</strong> of the department is reserved for members of the University of Münster. Respect the parking signs and recall that in Münster cars are towed rigorously. If you stay longer we advise you to take the free parking deck over the road.</p>
<p>If you would like to travel by car into the city you need to have a certified vehicle with a <a href="https://urbanaccessregulations.eu/countries-mainmenu-147/germany-mainmenu-61/munster">emission sticker</a>. The penalty for driving in a low emission zone in Germany without the sticker required is 80 € plus an administrative fee. Buy stickers only from the official city or TÜV websites. Other websites are often much more expensive, if they provide you with a valid sticker at all.</p>
<h2>Accomodation</h2>
<p>You are responsible for booking and paying for your accomodation yourself.</p>
