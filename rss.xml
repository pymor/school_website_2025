developers.
The seventh iteration of pyMOR School will take place in Zagreb, Croatia, from
Monday morning, September 8 to Friday noon, September 12.
A code sprint will take place on Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The School will offer interactive introductory lectures on some of the most
important MOR methods and how to use these methods with pyMOR.
We will also discuss pyMOR's technical design, how to contribute to pyMOR and
present some more advanced applications.
In the interactive sessions, participants will have the opportunity to either
get more hands-on experience with pyMOR through exercise problems or to work on
integrating pyMOR into their projects with the help of the pyMOR developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code sprint is an opportunity to get involved in pyMOR development with the
help of the pyMOR developers.
Of course, existing users and previous School participants are also invited to
join us for this year's pyMOR School.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://2025.school.pymor.org/posts/welcome/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
