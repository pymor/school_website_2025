Attendees at pyMOR School and User Meeting 2025 are subject to the NumFOCUS Code
of Conduct.

We value the participation of each attendee and want everyone to have an
enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other
attendees throughout the event and at all conference-related events, whether
officially sponsored by NumFOCUS or not.
Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

We encourage all event attendees to review the
[complete Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct).
